United States Emission Data Visualization Tool
---

Background:
---
---

This application displays Carbon Monoxide (CO) and Carbon Dioxide (CO2) emissions data across the United States. 
On launch the application loads twenty thousand CO data points from the emissions api. The map is filled
in with these data points, allowing a seamless view of CO across the country. Individual states on the map
can be clicked to display the historical CO2 data over the last 20 years for that state. 


Functionality & MVPs:
---
---

With this data visualization tool, users are able to:
* Visually compare emissions data on a US map which is color coated by amount of emissions released 
* Select individual states to render a chart depicting historical emission data for that specific state. 


In addition, this project includes:

* Data being fetched from the emissions API
